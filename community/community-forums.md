# Community Forums
The Music Encoding Initiative holds several virtual community forums throughout the year in addition to a community meeting at the annual conference. The forums and meeting are an opportunity for the MEI community to engage in discussion, provide feedback, and share updates from MEI Interest Groups, Technical Team, MEI Board, and MEI membership.
