    <h2>Statement on the use of generative AI in submissions for MEC 2026</h2>
    <p>
        We recognize that authors of academic works use a variety of tools in the research on 
        which they report, and to prepare the report itself, from simple ones to very sophisticated
        ones. We note that tools may generate useful and helpful results, but also errors or 
        misleading claims. Knowing which tools were used is relevant to evaluating
         and interpreting academic works. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In view of this, we
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            require authors to report in their work any significant use of software tools, such as 
            instruments and software that go beyond word processors or typesetters; we now include 
            in particular text-to-text generative AI among those that should be reported.
        </li>
        <li>
            remind all colleagues that by signing their name as an author of a contribution, they 
            each individually take full responsibility for all its contents, irrespective of how 
            the contents were generated. If use of generative AI results in inappropriate 
            language, plagiarized content, errors, mistakes, incorrect references, or misleading content, 
            and that output is included in academic works, it is the responsibility of the author(s). This
            may affect acceptance of your submission.
        </li>
        <li>
            do not accept generative AI language tools as an author; instead authors should refer to (1).
        </li>
    </ol>

        This statement is an adapted version of the 
        <a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2023/01/31/arxiv-announces-new-policy-on-chatgpt-and-similar-tools/">arXiv 
            policy for authorsâ€™ use of generative AI language tools</a>.
        We reserve the right to amend this statement as discussions continue and evolve.
