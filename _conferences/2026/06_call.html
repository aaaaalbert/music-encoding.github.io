    <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
    <p>The Music Encoding Conference&nbsp;provides a forum where researchers and
        practitioners from varied fields can meet and share new research built on digital music editions and,
        especially, research into music encoding itself. The Conference celebrates a multidisciplinary program,
        combining the latest advances from established music encodings, novel technical proposals and encoding
        extensions, and the presentation and evaluation of new practical applications of music encoding (e.g. in
        academic study, libraries, editions, pedagogy).</p>
    <p>When using and manipulating music in the digital domain, the properties and behaviours of its
        encoding are of fundamental importance. This applies equally for musicological study, music theory,
        production of digital editions, composition, performance, teaching and learning, cataloguing, symbolic music
        information retrieval and recommendation, or more general electronic presentation of musical material and
        associated narratives. It also applies for a wide range of musics,
        including those that are not conventionally notated at all. The study of music encoding and its applications
        is therefore a critical foundation for the use of music information by scholars, librarians, publishers, and
        the wider music industry.</p>
    <p>We welcome contributions from all those working on music encoding, but also
        those whose research builds on digital music resources or corpora. Newcomers are
        encouraged to submit to the main program, demonstrating with articulations of the potential for music
        encoding in their work, and highlighting strengths and weaknesses of existing approaches within this
        context. We always seek to broaden the scope of musical repertories considered, and to provide a welcoming,
        inclusive community for all who are interested in this work. The Music Encoding Conference is supported and
        organised by the Music Encoding Initiative, which will hold its annual community meeting on Friday, 6
        June.</p>
    <p>The main academic conference is preceded by pre-conference workshops and tutorials, which provide an
        opportunity to engage with the tools and good practices developed within the community, and this
        will be further reinforced by a showcase during the conference, where these tools can also be
        demonstrated.</p>
    <p>Following a formal program, unconference sessions will be held on 29th May 2026, designed to foster
        collaboration in the community through the meeting of Interest Groups, and open participation in
        discussions on hot topics that emerge during the conference. Spaces for these meetings have been
        generously provided by the hosting institution. As part of the conference, we would like to extend
        an invitation to attendees who may wish to organize additional meetings (e.g. project meetings) or
        other collaborative sessions in conjunction with the event. Availability of space for meetings during or
        immediately before or after the conference can be checked upon request. Please get in touch with conference
        organizers if you need to reserve these spaces.</p>
    <h2 id="topics">Topics</h2>

            conference, to
            address minor corrections or clarifications suggested during the review process. </p>
    <p>Please also refer to our <a href="/conference/2026/ai-statement">statement on
            the use of generative AI in submissions</a>. <br>Accepted abstracts&nbsp;will be
        published as part of the conference program and a Book of Abstracts after the
        conference.</p>
    <p>Authors are invited to upload their anonymized submissions for review to our
        Conftool website: <a href="https://www.conftool.net/mec2026/">https://www.conftool.net/mec2026/</a></p>
    <p>The deadline for all submissions is 28 November 2025 (see <a href="#dates">IMPORTANT DATES</a> above).
        When you upload into ConfTool, you will be asked for Title, Author information and the PDF
        of your submission. In addition, you will need to supply a short summary abstract and up
        to five keywords &ndash; these will be used for review assignment,
        but may also appear on the conference programme and website. Since review will be anonymous, please ensure
        that all identifying information is removed from your PDF before submission. </p>
    <p>Please use our <a href="https://tinyurl.com/MEC2026-Template">template at

        text of the proposal, excluding titles, keywords and references.</p>
    <h3 id="Submission-Long">Long papers: 1000-1500 words</h3>
    <p>Long papers are expected to present overviews or specific aspects of ongoing or completed
        projects, detailed case-studies or elaborated perspectives on best practices in the field, or provide
        in-depth reports on topics relevant to the conference. Speakers will be given 30 minutes: 20 minutes
        for their presentation, and 10 minutes for discussion.</p>
    <h3 id="Submission-Short">Short papers: 500-1000 words</h3>
    <p>Short papers are suitable for introducing tools, new ideas, and experimental topics. Speakers will be given
        15 minutes: 10 minutes for presentation, 5 minutes for discussion.</p>
    <h3 id="Submission-Panel">Panels: 1500-2000 words</h3>
    <p>Panels are suited to coordinated approaches or discussions relating to a single theme,
        or round-table discussions. Particularly welcome are those with interactive elements,
        such as Q&amp;A sessions or community consultation. Submissions should describe the
        topic and nature of the panel, along with its format, including titles and short
        abstracts for any presentations that will form part of the session. It should be
        clear from the text how any presentations are connected, and the way these will
        be integrated into the discussion. </p>
    <p>Themed sessions (independent papers relating to a single topic or project) will not be
        considered; instead these should be submitted as separate papers. Panel sessions
        will be given 90 minutes, which can be used flexibly.</p>
